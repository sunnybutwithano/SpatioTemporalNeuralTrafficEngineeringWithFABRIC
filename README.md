# The FABRIC setup file is used to configure resources and the topology on FABRIC.
# The files setup_adaptive_video.ipynb, and traffic engineering.ipynb are used to setup the video streaming applications on servers and clients.
# data_prep.ipynb is used to preprocess the generated data and plot figures.
# app.ipynb and traffic engineering.ipynb are used for the model training and traffic engineering respectively.
## app.ipynb loads the data, normalizes the data and trains the spatiotemporal model on the hyperparameter configuration sets.
## traffic engineering.ipynb uses the predictions of the model for the weights of a shortest path algorithm.
# The generated data files are uploaded here as well.
